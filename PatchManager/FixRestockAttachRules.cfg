	// Optional, but recommended
	longDescr = Restock makes all the engines in the stock game surface attachable, which I found a bit distracting while trying to build rockets. So I wrote this patch to fix them back to their original attachRules. Works even if you don't have Restock, and also fixes the weird attachRules of the MakingHistory engines.
