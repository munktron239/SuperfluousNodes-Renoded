	// Optional, but recommended
	longDescr = For when you like the idea of having a radially attached tank, but don't actually want to attach it radially. Gives nodes to all of the radial tanks in the game, including LFO, Monoprop, and Xenon tanks. Also supports the MakingHistory radial Monoprop tank. I'll even give the drain valve a node at no extra charge.
