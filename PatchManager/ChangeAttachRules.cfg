	// Optional, but recommended
	longDescr = While this mod tries to preserve the attachRules of the parts I modify, some parts just have the wrong rules. This patch tweaks a lot of parts to have much more sensible rules for attachment, including removing radial attachment (or adding it!), defining/removing node_attach, and much more. See PluginData/ChangeAttachRules.cfg for more info.
